1419,2021-03-29T16:06:28.000Z,So I would hope $TSLA is working hard on the regulatory front to get ahead of this FUD attack. Failure is not an option when lives are at stake.
1420,2021-03-29T16:06:27.000Z,If FUD attempts to limit $TSLA FSD are successful I believe it would severely dampen progression to a truly life saving resource. But that‚Äôs where it will come down to. So Tesla must prove without a doubt they are safe and safer than human drivers alone. Beyond a doubt.
1421,2021-03-29T16:06:27.000Z,My simple AP1 has saved my ass on at least three occasions over the last 6 years. Is it perfect. Of course not. I don‚Äôt expect it to drive me without human intervention. I can only imagine how safe the $TSLA FSD will make human driving- when used properly

1423,2021-03-29T16:06:27.000Z,I suspect the next avenue of attack for dismantling $TSLA FSD efforts will be regulatory. It‚Äôs already happening - Arguing against the safety of the software. The problem is this is simply false. When used properly this software will safe untold lives.
1424,2021-03-29T16:06:26.000Z,Now. The same thing is happening with FSD. From what I can gather $TSLA is well on its way to win / lead the autonomous driving battle. Again the FUD is getting thick as establishments feel threatened. Musk and team just need to deliver as promised. Recent track record +++
1425,2021-03-29T16:06:26.000Z,$TSLA won the electric car battle. It wasn‚Äôt easy. It took a team of innovators and Musk‚Äôs insatiable demand for excellence and desire to save the world when no one else stepped forward.
